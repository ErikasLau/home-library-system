# Home Library System
### Hierarchical Relationship

**Home Library** -> **Book** -> **Comment**

---

### Project Goal

The project's goal is to create a web platform that allows users to efficiently create and manage personal book libraries, share them with others, and write comments about books.

---

### Operating Principle

The platform consists of two parts: a **web interface** that users, personal library managers, or guests will use, and an **application programming interface (API)** that will be used to connect the web interface with the server.
